📌 What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging elements of an array in a specific order:

Ascending Order → Smallest to Largest

Descending Order → Largest to Smallest

Example:

Before sorting:
50 20 40 10 30

After sorting (Ascending):
10 20 30 40 50

🚀 Algorithms Implemented

This project includes the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

🛠️ 1️⃣ Bubble Sort

Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed

Repeatedly pushes the largest element to the end

Time Complexity: O(n²)
